-- LTL Properties

-- The system can only be armed if the key is pressed.
LTLSPEC !armed | key_pressed

-- If unauthorized access is detected while the system is armed, the alarm will be activated.
LTLSPEC !armed | !unauthorized_access | alarm_active

-- If a disarm command is issued, the system will be disarmed.
LTLSPEC disarm_command -> X(!armed)

-- The alarm should not activate if the system is disarmed.
LTLSPEC !armed -> !alarm_active

-- Additional LTL Properties

-- The system will only activate the alarm if it is armed and unauthorized access is detected.
LTLSPEC G (armed & unauthorized_access -> F alarm_active)

-- If the system is armed, it will eventually detect unauthorized access or receive a disarm command.
LTLSPEC G (armed -> F (unauthorized_access | disarm_command))

-- If the ignition is on, then it must be after a key press.
LTLSPEC G (ignition_on -> X key_pressed)

-- The system will not remain armed indefinitely without a key press.
LTLSPEC G (armed -> F key_pressed)
